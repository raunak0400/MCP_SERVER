# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in MCP Server, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to: security@mcp-server.dev
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce the issue if possible

### What to Include

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 72 hours with severity assessment
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Security patches released as soon as possible

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Environment Variables**: Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
2. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS in production environments
3. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and the server updated
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to plugins and APIs
6. **Rate Limiting**: Configure appropriate rate limits
7. **Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring for security events

### For Plugin Developers

1. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs
2. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate timeouts and memory limits
3. **Least Privilege**: Run plugins with minimal required permissions
4. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages
5. **Dependencies**: Regularly audit and update plugin dependencies

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Helmet.js**: Security headers enabled by default
- **Input Validation**: Zod-based request validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting middleware
- **CORS**: Configurable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage
- **Plugin Sandboxing**: Resource limits for external plugins

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT token support (extensible)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) ready
- API key authentication support
- Session management

### Data Protection

- Environment variable configuration
- Secret management integration ready
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding
- SQL injection prevention (when using databases)

## Known Security Considerations

### Plugin Execution

External plugins (Python, C, C++) execute as separate processes. While this provides some isolation, consider:

1. **Resource Limits**: Configure CPU and memory limits
2. **Network Access**: Restrict network access if not needed
3. **File System**: Limit file system access permissions
4. **Timeout**: Set execution timeouts to prevent DoS

### WebSocket Security

1. **Origin Validation**: Validate WebSocket origin headers
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement message rate limiting
3. **Authentication**: Authenticate WebSocket connections
4. **Message Validation**: Validate all incoming messages

## Security Audit

Regular security audits are performed using:

- npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- Snyk for continuous security monitoring
- CodeQL for static analysis
- Manual security reviews

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Implement containment measures
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve security measures
